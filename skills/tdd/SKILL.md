Implement features using strict test-driven development with vertical slices.

## Philosophy

**Core principle**: Tests verify behavior through public interfaces, not implementation details. Code can change entirely; tests shouldn't.

**Good tests** are integration-style: they exercise real code paths through public APIs. They describe *what* the system does, not *how*. A good test reads like a specification — "user can checkout with valid cart" tells you exactly what capability exists. These tests survive refactors because they don't care about internal structure.

**Bad tests** are coupled to implementation. They mock internal collaborators, test private methods, or verify through external means (like querying a database directly instead of using the interface). Warning sign: your test breaks when you refactor, but behavior hasn't changed.

## Anti-Pattern: Horizontal Slices

**DO NOT write all tests first, then all implementation.** This is "horizontal slicing" — treating RED as "write all tests" and GREEN as "write all code."

This produces bad tests because:
- Tests written in bulk test *imagined* behavior, not *actual* behavior
- You end up testing the *shape* of things rather than user-facing behavior
- Tests become insensitive to real changes
- You outrun your headlights, committing to test structure before understanding the implementation

**Correct approach**: Vertical slices via tracer bullets. One test -> one implementation -> repeat.

```
WRONG (horizontal):
  RED:   test1, test2, test3, test4, test5
  GREEN: impl1, impl2, impl3, impl4, impl5

RIGHT (vertical):
  RED->GREEN: test1->impl1
  RED->GREEN: test2->impl2
  RED->GREEN: test3->impl3
```

## Workflow

### 1. Planning

Confirm with the user:
- What should the public interface look like?
- Which behaviors are most important to test?
- Are there deep module opportunities?
- How should we design for testability?

### 2. Tracer Bullet

Write ONE test that confirms ONE thing:

```
RED:   Write test for first behavior -> test fails
GREEN: Write minimal code to pass -> test passes
```

### 3. Incremental Loop

For each remaining behavior:

```
RED:   Write next test -> fails
GREEN: Minimal code to pass -> passes
```

Rules:
- One test at a time
- Only enough code to pass the current test
- Don't anticipate future tests
- Keep tests focused on observable behavior

### 4. Refactor

After all tests pass:
- Extract duplication
- Deepen modules
- Apply SOLID principles
- Consider what new code reveals about existing code
- Run tests after each refactor step

**Never refactor while RED.**

### Checklist Per Cycle

```
[ ] Test describes behavior, not implementation
[ ] Test uses public interface only
[ ] Test would survive internal refactor
[ ] Code is minimal for this test
[ ] No speculative features added
```
